This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in F# related to mutable variables.  The `bug.fs` file contains code exhibiting the issue where a mutable variable is used before its value is properly assigned, leading to unexpected output.  The `bugSolution.fs` file presents the corrected code and explains the solution.  This is a useful example for understanding the nuances of mutable variables and the importance of assignment order in F#.
